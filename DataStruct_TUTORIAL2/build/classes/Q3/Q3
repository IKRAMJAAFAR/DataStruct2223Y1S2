What is a raw type? 
A generic class/interface used without specifying a concrete type/without a type parameter


Why is a raw type unsafe? 
- It can face a runtime error if they face different parameters type
- Cannot check the type and its safety

Why is the raw type allowed in Java?
- For backward compatiblity with per-Java 5 code -> Cannot support generics
