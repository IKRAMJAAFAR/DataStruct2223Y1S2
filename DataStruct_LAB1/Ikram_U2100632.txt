My name is Ikram with matrix number, U2100632. I am 
majoring in AI. This is my first time taking the 
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling nervous and excited about taking this 
subject. This is because I heard that it is going to be challenging but really benificial to all of us. 
I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I 
think I can manage to get A+ for this DS subject this term. In order 
to do well in the subject, I will learn more on YT and more from lecturers. Wish me luck!!!
